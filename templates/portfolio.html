					<p><strong>Contribution:</strong> Web Designer, Front-End Development</p>
					<p><strong>Description:</strong> This is an art gallery page that I designed for my friend that showcases all
						her paintings and sketchings.
						This was my first attempt at a real-world application using Flask so the code is all messy and held
						together with duct tape.</p>
					<p>I wanted to teach myself how to make clean websites from scratch using the Flask application and using
						Python Micro frameworks, object-oriented logic, HTML routes, JavaScript, and CSS styles, that incorporated
						secure database connections.</p>

					<p><strong>Description:</strong> GrokCode has been alive in one form or another since 2007. It was previously
						the home of the GrokCode Development Shop and blog, but now that I have moved away from consulting, it
						serves as an archive of articles on software development. It is a space for publishing tutorials, long form
						articles, and opinion pieces covering the various facets of building things on the internet.</p>

					<p>GrokCode is a Jekyll static site running on GitHub pages, with comments provided by Staticman.</p>

					<p><strong>More info:</strong> You&rsquo;re already here, but you can look at the <a
							href="{{ url_for('home') }}">homepage</a> or find out more <a href="{{ url_for('about') }}">about me</a>.</p>


					<h2 id="odds-n-ends">Odds &amp; Ends</h2>

					<p><strong>Joke generator:</strong> The joke generator is seeded with knowledge about different nouns and
						modifiers, then uses that vocabulary to make jokes. All of the jokes are of the form: &ldquo;What do you get
						when you
						cross X with Y?&rdquo;
						you get when you cross a port with Frosted Flakes?
						This code was written as a Midterm project for a graduate level class. </p>

					<p><strong>Bots:</strong> I have created and worked on many bots that moderate discord/reddit groups. </p>
